# Manage B2B organizations

If you have a business that offers Business-to-Business (B2B) solutions, you need to define the structure of your organization in {{ product_name }} so as to represent all your partner/supplier organizations. You can then share your applications and services with your partner/supplier organizations and allow them to manage their own identity and access management requirements.

- All partner/supplier organizations of your business should be set up as sub organizations of your primary organization in {{ product_name }}.

    !!! note
        See [Manage sub organizations](../../guides/organization-management/manage-b2b-organizations/manage-suborganizations/) for instructions.

- Once the sub organizations are set up, you should onboard administrators to them. These Administrators can then use a separate administration portal created using {{ product_name }}'s B2B APIs to manage their respective sub organizations.

    !!! note
        See [Manage administration](../../guides/organization-management/manage-b2b-organizations/manage-b2b-administration/) for instructions.

- The primary business organization needs to share applications with its sub organizations so that the users managed by the sub organizations can log in and use them.
