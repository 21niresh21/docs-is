# Email Domain-Based Organization Discovery

This guide explains how to configure and use email domain-based organization discovery in {{ product_name }}.

## Overview

In the realm of Business-to-Business (B2B) scenarios, it's essential to efficiently manage users from different organizations. 
One way to achieve this is through organization discovery based on criteria such as email domain and user attributes. 
{{ product_name }} offers a solution for email domain-based organization discovery.

The primary purpose of email domain based discovery is to route B2B users from various organizations to their respective authentication options based on their email addresses.

Consider a scenario where you have users, Alice and Bob, with email addresses alice@alpha.com and bob@beta.com, respectively. In this case, you would want to route Alice to the authentication options provided by the Alpha Organization and Bob to the Beta Organization.
