# Branding

By default, the business applications of your organization in {{ product_name }} are presented to your users with {{ product_name }} branding. You have the option of using your own branding as follows:

- [Customize the user interfaces (UIs)](../../guides/branding/configure-ui-branding/) of the user login, sign-up, and account recovery flows.
- [Customize the domain name](../../guides/branding/configure-custom-domains/). <Badge text="Paid subscription required" type="warn" />
- [Customize email notifications](../../guides/branding/customize-email-templates/)
