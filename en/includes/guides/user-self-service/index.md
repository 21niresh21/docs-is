# User self-service

You can incorporate self-service capabilities into your business application by invoking the [self-service APIs]({{base_path}}/apis/) provided by {{ product_name }}.

{{ product_name }} also provides a built-in self-service portal, which is currently in `Preview` mode, where users can manage their own {{ product_name }} accounts using the [My Account portal]({{base_path}}/guides/user-self-service/customer-self-service-portal.md).
