# Add Email OTP login

Email OTP is a form of passwordless authentication. It allows users to log in by providing a one-time passcode sent to their email instead of entering a password.

## Prerequisites
- To get started, you need to [register an application with {{ product_name }}](../../applications/). You can register your own application or use one of the [sample applications](../../get-started/try-samples/) provided.

- You need to have a user account in {{ product_name }}. If you don't already have one, [create a user account](../../get-started/create-asgardeo-account/#create-a-user) in {{ product_name }}.

    !!! note
        You cannot use an administrator account to log in to an application.
