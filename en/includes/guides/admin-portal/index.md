# Your {{ product_name }}

When you [create an account]({{base_path}}/get-started/create-asgardeo-account/) in {{ product_name }}, you define your first organization (root), which functions as the root organization or tenant in your {{ product_name }} subscription. From thereon, you (the account owner) or other delegated administrators can create multiple root organizations via the {{ product_name }} Console and switch between them.

Listed below are the main characteristics of an organization (root).
- An organization (root) contains applications, external identity providers, and user identities belonging to a single domain.
- Users or applications created in one organization (root) cannot access the resources of another organization (root) unless they are onboarded to that organization (root).
- The administrator who creates the organization (root) is the owner of the organization (root).

If you are an owner of an organization (root) or an administrator, you can manage your {{ product_name }} accounts [using the My Account portal]({{base_path}}/guides/{{ path }}/).

The owner is a user who creates an organization (root) in {{ product_name }}. This grants the owner all the administrative rights by default. An administrator is a user who is invited in to the organization (root) and assigned administrative privileges.
