# Manage attributes and mappings

Information directly related to users in an organization, such as username, email, address, etc., is stored as user attributes in {{ product_name }}. You can view the attributes, update them, and decide if and how they should appear in a user's profile. Learn more about [managing attributes in your organization](../../guides/users/attributes/manage-attributes/).

You can also map your [OpenID Connect attributes](../../guides/users/attributes/manage-oidc-attribute-mappings/) or [SCIM2 attributes](../../guides/users/attributes/manage-scim2-attribute-mappings/) to user attributes in your organization.
