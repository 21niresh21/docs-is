# Maintain Logins and Passwords

This section guides you on how to enhance the security of the {{product_name}} console by updating login details.

## Change the super admin password

To change the default admin password, log in to the {{product_name}} MyAccount portal with admin credentials and [change the password]({{base_path}}/guides/user-self-service/change-password/)

## Recover a password
You can recover the password using any of the following methods:

- Updating the `<IS_HOME>/bin/chpasswd.sh` script.
- Using the [password recovery]({{base_path}}/guides/account-configurations/account-recovery/password-recovery/) 
  option available on the {{product_name}} console.

## Log in with an email address
You can configure the {{product_name}} to authenticate users using an email address instead of a username. Refer to [Enable Using Email Address as the Username]({{base_path}}/guides/users/attributes/enable-email-as-username/) for further information.
