# Maintain Logins and Passwords

This section guides you on how to enhance the security of your WSO2 IS console application by updating login details.

## Change the super admin password

To change the default admin password, log in to the WSO2 Identity Server MyAccount portal with admin credentials and [change the password]({{base_path}}/guides/user-self-service/change-password/)

## Recover a password
You can recover the password using any of the following methods:

- Updating the `<IS_HOME>/bin/chpasswd.sh` script.
- Using the [password recovery]({{base_path}}/guides/user-accounts/password-recovery/) option available on the WSO2 IS console.

## Log in with an email address
You can configure the WSO2 Identity Server to authenticate users using an email address instead of a username. Refer to [Enable Using Email Address as the Username]({{base_path}}/guides/user-accounts/account-login/username-validation/) for further information.
