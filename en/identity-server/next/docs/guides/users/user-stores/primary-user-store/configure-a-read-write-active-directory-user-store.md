# Configure a Read-write Active Directory User store

!!! tip    
    For Read-only Active Directory user store manager configuration, use [read-only LDAP user store manager configuration properties]({{base_path}}/guides/users/user-stores/primary-user-store/configure-a-read-only-ldap-user-store/).

Refer [Properties for a read-write Active Directory user store]({{base_path}}/guides/users/user-stores/user-store-properties/properties-read-write-active-directory-user-store/) to find the properties which are supported for read-write Active Directory user stores. Below is a sample with minimum configurations and properties to change the primary user store to a read-write Active Directory user store.

```toml
[user_store]
type = "active_directory_unique_id"
base_dn = "dc=wso2,dc=org"
connection_url = "ldaps://10.100.1.102:639"
connection_name = "cn=admin,ou=system"
connection_password = "admin"
```

In addition to the above, please make sure that you import the Active Directory user store public certificate to the 
WSO2 Identity Serverâ€™s client trust store. To perform this, you need to navigate to the 
`<IS_HOME>repository/resources/security` directory and execute the following command to import the certificate to 
client-truststore of WSO2 Identity Server.

```
keytool -import -alias certalias -file <certificate>.pem -keystore client-truststore.jks -storepass wso2carbon
```

!!! note
    `wso2carbon` is the keystore password of the default client-truststore.jks file of WSO2 Identity Server.

Furthermore, please make sure to follow the steps mentioned in [Configure Active Directory User stores for SCIM 2.0 based Inbound Provisioning]({{base_path}}/guides/users/user-stores/configure-active-directory-user-stores-for-scim2) 
since SCIM is enabled by default from the WSO2 Identity Server 5.10.0 onwards.


### Configuring a fresh server
If you are configuring a server that has not been started yet, you need to update the claim mappings in
`<carbon_home>/repository/conf/claim-config.xml`.

!!! note
    Following are some of the mandatory claims that you need to map with the user store attributes.

      - `http://wso2.org/claims/username`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/userid`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/created`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/modified`

    For `created` and `modified` claims, it is recommended to use the `whenCreated` and `whenChanged` 
    operational attributes.

### Configuring an already started server
Before you change `deployment.toml` with above configurations, you need to change the claim mappings for the
`PRIMARY` user store by navigating to the `User Attributes & Stores > Attributes` section of the console. After
updating the mappings, shutdown the server, update the `deployment.toml` and restart the server to apply the
configurations.

!!! note
    Following are some of the mandatory claims that you need to map with the user store attributes.

      - `http://wso2.org/claims/username`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/userid`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/created`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/modified`
    
    Refer to the [Update Attributes]({{base_path}}/guides/users/attributes/manage-attributes/#update-attributes) 
    to learn more on updating attribute mappings.  For `created` and `modified` claims, it is recommended to use the 
    `whenCreated` and `whenChanged` operational attributes.

    !!! Warning
        If you have more than one tenant, you need to change the claim mappings for each tenant before adding the 
        new configurations to the `deployment.toml` file.
        
        If are planning to create new tenants in the future, you need to update the claim mappings in 
        `<carbon_home>/repository/conf/claim-config.xml`. 


## Configure tenant Manager
Configure the tenant manager to user CommonHybridLDAPTenantManager.  Make sure to configure `RootPartition` property
as it determines the root of the LDAP tree.

``` toml
[tenant_manager.ldap]
enabled=true
class="org.wso2.carbon.user.core.tenant.CommonHybridLDAPTenantManager"
[tenant_manager.ldap.properties]
RootPartition="dc=example,dc=org"
```
