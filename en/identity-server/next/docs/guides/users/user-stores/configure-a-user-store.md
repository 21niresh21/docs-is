# Connect a remote user store

You can connect your on-premise user store to WSO2 Identity Server and onboard users and groups from it. Depending on your requirement, you can provide the user store connection either read-only or read/write privilges.

Follow the guide below to connect a remote user store to WSO2 Identity Server.

## Register a remote user store
To configure a remote user store for your organization:

1. On the WSO2 Identity Server Console, go to **User Attributes & Stores** > **User Stores**.
2. Click **New User Store** and select the user store type.

3. Enter the following details according to the user store type and click **Finish**.
