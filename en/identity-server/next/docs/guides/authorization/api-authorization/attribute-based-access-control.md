# XACML Scope Validator

WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) allows you to validate the scope of an OAuth access token using XACML policies to provide fine-grained access control to APIs.

If you want the XACML scope validator to execute after checking the validity of the access token in an OAuth access token validation flow, you can select the scope validator as XACML when you configure a service provider. This provides fine-grained access control to APIs.
