# Configure X509 Certificate Authenticator

This page guides you through configuring the X509 certificate authenticator with WSO2 Identity Server.

??? note "Prerequisites"

    You need to create the neccessary certificates and truststores before you start configuirng the x509 authenticator on the WSO2 Identity Server.

    X509 authentication requires the client to possess a Public Key Certificate (PKC).

    To create a sample certificate and create your own Certificate Authority to sign the certificates, follow the following steps:

    1. Create the private RSA key using the following command.

        ``` shell
        openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048
        ```

        For this example, we have used the key size as `2048`, you can specify the key size as you wish.

    2. Using the key created in step 1, generate a certificate that is valid for ten years using the following command:

        ``` shell
        openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key rootCA.key -out rootCA.crt
        ```

    3. You are prompted to provide the following details, and the details you provide are incorporated into the certificate request. An example is shown below.

        ```text
        - Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]: SL
        - State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]: Western
        - Locality Name (eg, city) [ ]: Colombo
        - Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]: WSO2
        - Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) [ ]: QA
        - Common Name (e.g. serverFQDN or YOUR name) [ ]: wso2is.com
        - Email Address [ ]: kim@wso2.com
        ```

    4. Create files and directories required for the CA.
        1. Create a new directory according to the `openssl.conf` format.

            ``` shell
            mkdir -p demoCA/newcerts
            ```

        2. Create some initial files inside your CA directory structure.

            ``` shell
            touch demoCA/index.txt
            echo '01' > demoCA/serial
            ```

    5. For the JVM to trust your certificate, import your certificate into your JVM truststore.

        You can use the following command by updating the values for `<path_to_the_jvm_truststore>` and `<password_of_the_truststore>`.

        ``` shell
        keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias rootCA -file rootCA.crt -keystore <path_to_the_jvm_keystore> -storepass <password_of_the_keystore>
        ```

        !!! info "Permission Denied?"
            If you get a permission denied error when adding the certificate to the JVM trust store, run the above command with administrative privileges.

    6. Create the server certificate.

        To create the server certificate:

        1. Create the keystore that includes the private key by executing the following command:

            !!! abstract ""
                **Command format**
                ``` shell
                keytool -genkey -v -alias <alias> -keyalg RSA -validity 3650 -keystore <keystore-name> -storepass <password> -keypass <password>
                ```
                ---
                **Command Sample**
                ``` shell
                keytool -genkey -v -alias localcrt -keyalg RSA -validity 3650 -keystore localcrt.jks -storepass localpwd -keypass localpwd
                ```

            You will be prompted to enter the following details before creating the keystore.

            !!! tip
                For "What is your first and last name?", provide the name without any spaces.

            ![Creating keystore prompt]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/mfa/x509/create-keystore.png){: width="700" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

        2. Use the created keystore file to generate a certificate signing request(CSR).

            !!! abstract ""
                **Command format**
                ``` shell
                keytool -certreq -alias <alias> -file <name-of-the-csr-file> -keystore <created-keystore-name> -storepass <keystore-password>
                ```
                ---
                **Command Sample**
                ``` shell
                keytool -certreq -alias localcrt -file localcrt.csr -keystore localcrt.jks -storepass localpwd
                ```

        3. Configure the necessary openSSL extension configurations by adding the following configurations under `x509_extensions` in the `/usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf` file or the `validation.cnf` file.

            ```
            crlDistributionPoints = URI:http://pki.google.com/GIAG2.crl
            authorityInfoAccess = OCSP;URI: http://clients1.google.com/ocsp
            ```

            This configuration is required to enable CRL or OCSP-based certificate revocation validation.

            !!! info
                - CRL is a list of digital certificates that have been revoked by the issuing CA.
                - OCSP is an internet protocol that is used for obtaining the revocation status of an X509 digital certificate using the certificate serial number.

        4. Sign the CSR using the CA's root key.

            !!! abstract ""
                **Command format**
                ``` shell
                openssl ca -batch -startdate <validity-start-date> -enddate <validity-end-date> -keyfile <private-RSA-key-from-step-1> -cert <certificate-generated-in-step-2> -policy policy_anything -config <path-to-the-openssl.cf-file> -notext -out localcrt.crt -infiles <CSR-created-in-step-6.ii>
                ```
                ---
                **Command Sample**
                ``` shell
                openssl ca -batch -startdate 150813080000Z -enddate 250813090000Z -keyfile rootCA.key -cert rootCA.crt -policy policy_anything -config /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf -notext -out localcrt.crt -infiles localcrt.csr
                ```

            This creates a signed certificate called `localcrt.crt` that is valid for a specified period that is denoted by the `startdate` and `enddate`.

            ![Signed CSR]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/mfa/x509/signed-csr.png){: width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

        5. Import the CA and signed certificate into the keystore.

            !!! abstract "Import the CA"
                **Command format**
                ``` shell
                keytool -importcert -alias <CA's-alias> -file <certificate-generated-in-step-2> -keystore <keystore-name> -storepass <keystore-password> -noprompt
                ```
                ---
                **Command Sample**
                ``` shell
                keytool -importcert -alias rootCA -file rootCA.crt -keystore localcrt.jks -storepass localpwd -noprompt
                ```

            !!! abstract "Import the signed certificate"
                **Command format**
                ``` shell
                keytool -importcert -alias <certificate-alias> -file <path-to-the-signed-certificate> -keystore  <keystore-name> -storepass <keystore-password> -noprompt
                ```
                ---
                **Command Sample**
                ``` shell
                keytool -importcert -alias localcrt -file demoCA/newcerts/01.pem -keystore localcrt.jks -storepass localpwd -noprompt
                ```

        6. Create the `pkcs12` out of the `.crt` file using the command below. as it has been used to import certificates to the browser.

            ??? note "What is a PKCS #12?"
                **PKCS #12**, or Public-Key Cryptography Standards #12, is a file format commonly used for storing cryptographic objects such as private keys, public keys, and certificates in a single, password-protected container.
                A PKCS #12 file, often represented with the `.p12` or `.pfx` extension, is a container format that can store a certificate and its associated private key.

            !!! abstract ""
                **Command format**
                ``` shell
                keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <keystore-name> -destkeystore <pkcs12-file-name.p12> -srcstoretype JKS -deststoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass <keystore-password> -deststorepass <pkcs12-file-password> -srcalias <keystore-alias> -destalias <pkcs12-file-alias> -srckeypass <password> -destkeypass <password> -noprompt
                ```
                ---
                **Command Sample**
                ``` shell
                keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore localcrt.jks -destkeystore localhost.p12 -srcstoretype JKS -deststoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass localpwd -deststorepass browserpwd -srcalias localcrt -destalias browserKey -srckeypass localpwd -destkeypass browserpwd -noprompt
                ```

            Make sure to use the same password you used when creating the keystore for the `srcstorepass` in the above step.

            Upon successful execution of the above command you will have a `.p12` file created.You can import this file into your browser, as explained in the [import certificate](#import-certificate) section.

    7. Create a new truststore and import the server certificate into the truststore using the following commands:

        ``` xml
        keytool -import -keystore cacerts.jks -storepass cacertspassword -alias rootCA -file rootCA.crt -noprompt
        keytool -importcert -alias localcrt -file localcrt.crt -keystore cacerts.jks -storepass cacertspassword -noprompt
        ```

        !!! tip "CN"
            The User objects in the LDAP directory hierarchy have designators that start with CN, meaning Common Name. The CN designator applies to all but a few object types. Active Directory only uses two other object designators (although LDAP defines several).

    Once you have done the above steps, you will have the keystore (`localcrt.jks`), truststore (`cacerts.jks`), and pkcs12 (`localhost.p12`) files that you need to use later on in this guide.

## Add the X509 certificate

To add your x509 certificate to the WSO2 Identity Server, add the following configuration to the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

Replace the values for your keystore file path, keystore password, trust store file path, and trust store password.

!!! note
    If you dont have a keystore and truststore, refer the prerequisites section of this guide to create them.

``` toml
[custom_transport.x509.properties]
protocols="HTTP/1.1"
port="8443"
maxThreads="200"
scheme="https"
secure=true
SSLEnabled=true
keystoreFile="/path/to/keystore.jks"
keystorePass="keystorepwd"
truststoreFile="/path/to/truststore.jks"
truststorePass="truststorespassword"
bindOnInit=false
clientAuth="want"
ssl_protocol = "TLS"
```

!!! note
    Consider the following factors when adding the above config to the `deployment.toml` file:

    - This connector should come first in order to function properly. Otherwise, when mutual SSL occurs, the existing connector (9443) will be picked up, and the certificate will not be retrieved correctly.

    - The `clientAuth` attribute determines the Tomcat server to decide the level of requirement for a client to provide a certificate. It can be configured in the following ways:

        - `true`: A valid client certificate is mandatory for a successful connection.

        - `want`: Tomcat will use a certificate if it's available, but it will still allow the connection even if no certificate is provided.

        - `false`: No client certificate is required or validated for the connection.

    - The `truststoreFile` attribute specifies the location of the truststore that contains the trusted certificate issuers.

## Disable certificate validation

The location that is used to disable certificate validation depends on whether the WSO2 Identity Server was started at least once or not.

- **For an unstarted WSO2 Identity Server Pack**

    If you have never started the WSO2 Identity Server before, the configurations should be made on the `deployment.toml` file. To disable certificate validation if your WSO2 Identity Server pack has never been started.

    1. Open the `deployment.toml` file in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf` directory.

    2. Add the following configuration to disable CRL-based certificate validation and OCSP-based certificate validation.

        ```toml
        [certificate_validation]
        ocsp_validator_enabled = false
        crl_validator_enabled = false
        ```

- **For an already-started WSO2 Identity Server pack**

    If you have started the WSO2 Identity Server at least once, the configurations should be made on the registry parameters. To disable certificate validation if the WSO2 Identity Server was started before.

    1. On the WSO2 Identity Server management Console, go to **Main** > **Registry** > **Browse**.  

    2. Disable CRL certificate validation.

        1. Search for `system/governance/repository/security/certificate/validator/crlvalidator` in the **Location** search box.  

        2. Expand **Properties**.

            ![crlvalidator-properties]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/crlvalidator-properties.png)

        3. Click **Edit** corresponding to the **enable** property.  

        4. Change the value to `false` and click **Save**.  

    4. Similarly, disable OCSP certificate validation in the `system/governance/repository/security/certificate/validator/ocspvalidator` registry parameter.

    <!--- For more information on CRL and OCSP certificate validation, see
    [Configuring Certificate Revocation Validation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ISCONNECTORS/Configuring+Certificate+Revocation+Validation). -->

## Configure the Authentication Endpoint

To configure the authentication endpoint:

1. Add the following configuration to the file to the `deployment.toml` file in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/` directory.

    ``` toml
    [authentication.authenticator.x509_certificate.parameters]
    name ="x509CertificateAuthenticator"
    enable=true
    AuthenticationEndpoint="https://localhost:8443/x509-certificate-servlet"
    username= "CN"
    ```

    | Parameter | Description   |
    |-----------|---------------|
    | name      | This attribute identifies the authenticator that is configured as the second authentication step. |
    | enable    | This attribute, when set to true, makes the authenticator capable of being involved in the authentication process.    |
    | AuthenticationEndpoint    | This is the URL with the port that is secured with the certificate, for example: `https://localhost:8443/x509-certificate-servlet`. Update this based on your hostname.   |
    | username  | This attribute value will be taken as the authenticated user subject identifier. Update this with any certificate attributes, e.g., CN and Email  |

    !!! note
        When X509 authentication is configured as the second authentication step, the certificate will be validated to check whether it is associated with the authenticated user in the first authentication step. For that, the `username` parameter will be used. For that, the authenticated user name considered in the first authentication step will be validated with the certificate attribute in this property.

        When X509 authentication is configured as the first step, this certificate attribute will be treated as the authenticated user subject identifier.


3. If you are using the identity claim dialect URI to store the X509 certificate, add the following parameter.

    ``` toml
    [authentication.authenticator.x509_certificate.parameters]
    setClaimURI = "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/userCertificate"
    ```

4. To enable storing the X509 certificate as a user claim, add the following parameter.

    ``` toml
    [authentication.authenticator.x509_certificate.parameters]
    EnforceSelfRegistration = true
    ```

5. Restart the server to apply the changes.

---

## Add a claim mapping for the certificate

If storing the certificate as a user claim is enabled, the X509
certificate will be stored as a user claim and verified with the
retrieved certificate from the request.

1. Log in to the WSO2 Identity Server Management Console (`https://<IS_HOST>:<PORT>/carbon`) using administrator credentials (`admin:admin`).

2. On the **Main** tab, click **Claims > Add**.

    ![add-claim]({{base_path}}/assets/img/fragments/add-claim.png)

3. Click **Add Local Claim**.  

    ![add-local-claim]({{base_path}}/assets/img/fragments/add-local-claim.png)

4. Add a new claim for the **certificate** by giving the details below, e.g., select a mapped attribute for the claim that is supported by the underlying database type.

    ![claim-mapped-attribute]({{base_path}}/assets/img/fragments/claim-mapped-attribute.png)

5. Click **Add**.

## Update the column size of the database for X509 certificates

Make a note of the following points and configure your database to match your use case:  
  
- [Disabling Certificate Validation in an Unstarted WSO2 IS Pack](#disable-certificate-validation-in-an-unstarted-wso2-is-pack)
- [Disabling Certificate Validation in an Already-started WSO2 IS Pack](#disable-certificate-validation-in-an-already-started-wso2-is-pack)

## Register a service provider

The next step is to configure the service provider.

1. Return to the management console.
2. In the **Service Providers** section under the **Main** tab, click **Add**.
3. Since you are using Travelocity as the sample, enter travelocity.com in the **Service Provider Name** text box and click **Register**.
4. In the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section, click **Configure** under the **SAML2 Web SSO Configuration** section.
5. Now set the configuration as follows:  
    1. **Issuer** : travelocity.com
    2. **Assertion Consumer URL** : http://localhost:8080/travelocity.com/home.jsp
6. Select the following check-boxes:
    1. **Enable Response Signing**.
    2. **Enable Single Logout**.
    3. **Enable Attribute Profile**.
    4. **Include Attributes in the Response Always**.

    <!-- ![configure-sp]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/configure-sp.png) -->

7. Click **Update** to save the changes. Now, you will be sent back to the **Service Providers** page.
8. Go to the **Local and Outbound Authentication Configuration** section.
9. You have two options here. You can add the X509 certificate authenticator as the first factor and also as the second factor.

    1. Second factor  
        1. Select the **Advanced** configuration radio button option.

        2. Add the **Username & Password** authentication as a first step and **X509 Certificate** authentication as the second step.  
            <!-- ![first-step-authentication]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/first-step-authentication.png) -->

    2. First factor
        - Select **Local Authentication** as the **Authentication Type** and select **X509 Certificate** from the drop-down list.  
            <!-- ![first-factor-x509]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/first-factor-x509.png) -->
        - When using X509 as the first step of authentication, you need to create a user in the WSO2 Identity Server management console with the Email provided while creating the browser certificate.  
        Example:  
            <!-- ![browser-certificate]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/browser-certificate.png) -->

            !!! note
                For more information on creating users and assigning roles using the management console, refer [here]({{base_path}}/learn/configuring-users-roles-and-permissions).

10. Click on **Update** to finish the service provider configurations.

You have now added and configured the service provider.
