# Introduction to Authentication Protocols

### What is an Authentication Protocol?
A protocol is a set of pre-defined rules used when two or multiple parties are communicating. An authentication protocol
is a type of computer communications protocol, that is designed to transfer authentication data between two or more entities.

### Password authentication protocol
This is one of the oldest protocols used in the authentication. When using this protocol the authentication happens 
using typical user-name and password approach. Even though this approach is simple to use and deploy it has some security
considerations. If a malicious user is able to guess or obtain the password of a legitimate user, he can access the system.

As a solution for the security issues raised in the typical password authentication protocol, to securely transmit the 
authentication data between entities, advanced authentication protocols came into play.
