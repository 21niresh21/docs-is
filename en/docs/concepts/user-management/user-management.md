# Introduction to User Management 

In a typical organization, there are several employees who are responsible for accomplishing a versatile set of tasks on a daily basis with the help of different applications. Most of the times, even the same application is used in different ways by employees who have differenet job roles. Managing who accesses which application for what purposes can be an overhead for the administration. This is why user management is important. 

A user management implementation involves a wide range of functionality such as adding/deleting users, controlling user activity through permissions, and managing user roles. 

User management enables: 

- Defining users
- Managing users 
- Defining roles 
- Managing roles
- Managing access levels of the users
