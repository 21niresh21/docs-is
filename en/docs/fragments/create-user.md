1.  Once you log in to the Identity Server, navigate to the **Main** menu in the Management Console, click **Add** 
    under **Users and Roles**.
2.  Click **Users**. This link is only visible to users with the Admin role.
3.  Click **Add New User**.Â  When adding a new user, use an email address as the username. Since it is not mandatory
