# ReCaptcha On Invalid Password Attempts

The password account recovery feature implemented in the WSO2 Identity Server helps to recover the password of the account in case the user forgets it. This recovery process can also be secured with captcha verification.

By configuring reCaptcha, you can mitigate or block brute force attacks.
