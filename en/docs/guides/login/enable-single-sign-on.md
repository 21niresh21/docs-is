# Enable Single Sign On for your applications

Single sign-on is a key feature of the WSO2 Identity Server that enables users to access multiple applications using the
same set of credentials. Additionally, the user can access all these applications without having to log into each 
application individually. For instance, if users log into application A, they would automatically have access to 
application B as well for the duration of that session without having to re-enter their credentials.

This section guides you through enabling SSO for your application using WSO2 Identity Server.
