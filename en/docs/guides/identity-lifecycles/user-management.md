# User Management - Overview

Users in WSO2 Idenity Server (WSO2 IS) are the digital representations of the identities of physical users who interact with your applications. Administrators can easily manage the identity lifecycle of each of these users from the Management Console.

Each individual user is able to manage one's own profile by signing in to the My Account portal. Learn more about [self-service capabilities]({{base_path}}/guides/my-account/my-account) in WSO2 IS.
