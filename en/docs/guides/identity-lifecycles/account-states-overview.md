# Manage User Accounts

A user account is the digital representation of a physical user who interacts with an application. It is an entity that comprises the private information such as the user name and password of a user.

There are certain operations that need to be performed on a specific user account based on certain situations. These activities are mostly performed to make sure the user account is safe and it is the user who is trying to access it.
