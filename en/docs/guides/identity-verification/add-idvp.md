# Registering an identity verification provider

WSO2 Identity Server allows you to add identity verification providers (IDVP) and specify various details that help you link the identity verification provider to the WSO2 Identity Server. 
To properly configure the IDVPs, you must specify all information required to perform identity verification.

This guide walks you through adding and configuring identity verification providers based on your requirements.
