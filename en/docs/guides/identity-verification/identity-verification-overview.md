# Identity Verification

Identity verification(IDV), is a crucial component of managing user access and verifying identities in systems and platforms. 
It enables organizations to confirm the identity of users through various authentication methods, such as by 
checking legal documents, like passports, national identification cards, and driver's licenses.

IDV is a critical aspect of security and risk management, as it helps to prevent identity fraud and ensures that 
only authorized individuals have access to sensitive systems and data. By having IDV, organizations can protect 
themselves from potential threats and enhance the overall security of their systems.
