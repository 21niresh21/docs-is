# Configure Adaptive Authentication for an Application

This page guides you through setting up [adaptive authentication](../../../references/concepts/authentication/adaptive-authentication) for an application.


## Prerequisites

You need to [register a service provider](../applications/register-sp.md) on the Management Console.

## Add an adaptive authentication script

Make the following changes to the created service provider.

To add an authentication script to the service provider:

{!fragments/add-adaptive-script.md!}

    If required, you can also use the script editor to introduce new functions and fields to an authentication script based on your requirement, and then engage the script to the service providerâ€™s authentication step configuration. 

    !!! note
    
        - To learn about the functions and fields related to authentication scripts, see [Adaptive Authentication JS API Reference](../../../references/adaptive-authentication-js-api-reference).
        
        - To learn about the guidelines on writing custom functions for adaptive authentication, see [Write Custom Functions for Adaptive Authentication](../../../develop/extend/write-custom-functions-for-adaptive-authentication).

    A sample authentication script is shown below. 

    ```java
    var onLoginRequest = function(context) {
        // Some possible initializations...
        executeStep(1, {
            onSuccess: function (context) {
                // Logic to execute if step 1 succeeded
                executeStep(2, {
                    onSuccess: function (context){
                        // Logic to execute if step 2 succeeded
                    },
                    onFail: function (context){
                        // Logic to execute if step 2 failed
                    }
                });
            }
            onFail: function(context){
                // Logic to execute if step 1 failed
                executeStep(3);
            }
        });
    }
    
    function someCommonFunction(context) {
        // Do some common things
    }
    ```
