# Integrate a JavaScript application
Follow the steps given below to authenticate users to a sample JavaScript service provider with OpenID Connect.

## Prerequisites
Only customer users can log in to applications. [Create a user account]({{base_path}}/guides/identity-lifecycles/onboard-overview) if you don't already have one.

## Configure a service provider

1. On the WSO2 Identity Server management console (`https://<IS_HOST>:<PORT>/carbon`) go to **Main** > **Identity** > **Service Providers**.
2. Click **Add** and enter a **Service Provider Name**.
3. Click **Register** to complete the registration.
4. Expand **Inbound Authentication Configuration** > **OAuth/OpenID Connect Configuration** and click **Configure**.
5. Enter the **Callback URL** as `https://localhost:5000`.

    !!! note
        The **Callback URL** is the exact location in the service provider's application to which an access token will be sent. This URL should be the landing page to which the user is redirected after successful authentication.

6. Click **Add** to complete the configuration. 

    !!! note
        Make a note of the **OAuth Client Key** and **OAuth Client Secret** that appear, as it will be used to configure the sample application.

## Download the sample
Download the latest release of the [sample JavaScript application](https://github.com/asgardeo/asgardeo-auth-spa-sdk/releases/latest/download/asgardeo-html-js-app.zip).

## Configure the sample
1. Open the `index.html` file located at the root of the project.
2. Scroll down to the `<script>` tag at the end of the body tag and find `authConfig` object and change the configurations with the relevant values.
    - **clientID** - Add the client id of the registered application. The client ID can be copied from **Inbound Authentication Configuration > OAuth/OpenID Connect Configuration** section of your service provider.

    - **serverOrigin** - `https://localhost:9443`

    - **scope** - The list of OIDC scopes that are used for requesting user information. The ``openid`` and the ``profile`` scopes are mandatory to get the ID token. You can add other OIDC scopes such as ``email``.

    ``` 
        {
            "clientID": "<client ID>",
            "serverOrigin": "https://localhost:9443",
            "signInRedirectURL": "https://localhost:5000",
            "signOutRedirectURL": "https://localhost:5000",
            "scope": [ "openid", "profile" ]
        }
    ``` 

## Run the sample

Run the following command at the root of the project to start up the sample application. The app will be accessible at `https://localhost:5000`. 

```
npm install && npm start
```

Log in to Identity Server management console using your user account credentials.
