# Try app login

Now that you have [onboarded to Asgardeo](../../get-started/create-asgardeo-account/), let's see how the application login flow with Asgardeo works.

## Asgardeo Try It app

We have already set up and configured an application for you, which is the **Asgardeo Try It** app.

Let's try a simple login flow in the Asgardeo Try It application:

1. On the [Asgardeo Console](https://console.asgardeo.io/login), navigate to **Home** and click **Try login with the Try It app**.
    !!! note
        You need a user account to try out login. A dialog will appear prompting you to create a user account. Note that this dialog only appears if it is your first time.

        Learn more about various [user accounts in Asgardeo](../../guides/users/).

2. If you don't already have a user created, click the link for creating a user and follow the instructions.

3. When you are ready with the user account, click **Continue** to proceed.

    !!! note
        The process creates the **Asgardeo Try It** Application in the **Applications** section and redirects you to the login page of the application.

4. Use credentials of a user to log in to the application.

## Customize the login flow

To try out a customized login flow:

1. On the Asgardeo Console, go to **Applications**, and select the **Asgardeo Try It** application.

2. Go to the **Sign-in Method** tab of the application and select the authentication method that you wish to try:

    - [Social login](../../guides/authentication/social-login/)
    - [Standard-based login](../../guides/authentication/enterprise-login/)
    - [Passwordless login](../../guides/authentication/passwordless-login/)
    - [Multi-factor authentication](../../guides/authentication/mfa/)

    !!! note
        Alternatively, to customize the login flow, navigate to **Home** and click the gear icon that appears next to the **Try login with the Try It app** card after you have tried the default login at least once.

3. Once you **Update** the sign-in methods, click **Try Login** to try the customized login flow.

!!! note
    Note that the **Try It** application is a preview app which allows you to make limited configurations. Learn about all the configurations available in Asgardeo in our [guides](../../guides/).
