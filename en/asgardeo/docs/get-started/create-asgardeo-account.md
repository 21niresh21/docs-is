# Create your Asgardeo account

Let's begin setting up your Asgardeo account.

1. Go to the [Asgardeo webpage](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/) and click **Sign up for free**.

2. Enter your email address and click **Register**. You will receive an email with instructions on how to complete your account creation.

        You can also use one of the social login methods to create your account.


!!! tip "Access the Asgardeo Console"

    As an organization owner, or an administrator, you can manage all organizations, applications and users that you create using the Asgardeo Console. You can access the console using the following link.

    ```curl

    https://console.asgardeo.io/

    ```



## Create a user

Users can log in to applications that you register in Asgardeo. Let's create your first user by following the steps below.

1. On the Asgardeo Console, click **Users**.
2. Click **Add User**.
3. Fill in the user's details.

4. Select **Set a password for the user** and enter a temporary password for the user. The user will be able to change the password later.

6. Click **Next** and **Finish**.

You can now manage this user account from the Asgardeo Console.

    Users can also manage their own accounts from the Asgardeo self-service portal. Learn more about [user self-service]({{base_path}}/guides/user-self-service/).
